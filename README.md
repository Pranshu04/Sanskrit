# Sanskrit
Sanskrit is a sanskrit vocabulary application.

It is done with the help of Udacity's [Android Basics: Multi-screen Apps](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multi-screen-apps--ud839).
   

 **Features:**
 -   Sanskrit Translation along with English Translation
 -   Audio for correct pronunciation by pressing on Each Translation
 -   Tabbed navigation pattern for quick and easy navigation.
 -   Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.
 
 
**What I have learned from this project:**

  -  Planning an app design and navigation before coding.
  -  Working with Intents and Activities.
  -  View Recycling
  -  Using Mediaplayer class, AudioManager Service and Audio focus
  -  Navigating between sections using ViewPager and TabLayout.
